# Head-Start-TTA
Head Start TTA Data Platform PA + E&amp;I + Assisted Acquisition 

# Welcome!
This repo contains documentation describing the Head Start - Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) Platform Path Analysis (PA), Experiment & Iterate (E&I), and Assisted Acquisition (AA) project from 18F. It is intended to be a public place where project participants can keep track of the overall project goals, progress to date, and learnings as we work. This is also intended to be a project 'home page' where members can access important and up-to-date project information that exists somewhere else.

## Project Description

The Head Start program promotes school readiness for children under 5 years old from low-income families. HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF)’s Office of Head Start (OHS) oversees grant funding to local agencies providing Head Start services. OHS’s federal oversight responsibilities require significant grants management and a robust system of Training and Technical Assistance (TTA), designed to strengthen grantee performance in accordance with federal standards so every enrolled child is prepared for success in school. However, TTA data collection is fragmented, and data is housed in 27 disconnected platforms, including a limited and unscalable legacy system.

OHS is engaging 18F to help OHS procure a centralized system for relevant TTA data, to track and analyze their work through a combined Path Analysis and Experimentation and Iteration (E&I) approach, with the potential to also execute an assisted acquisition. OHS is engaging 18F to help them identify and define the scope of the procurement for a new, modular TTA platform.
