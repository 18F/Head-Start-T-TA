Head Start T/TA Data Platform PA + E&amp;I  

# Welcome!
This repo contains documentation describing the Head Start - Training and Technical Assistance Platform Path Analysis project from 18f. It is intended to be a public place where project participants can keep track of the overall project goals, progress to date and learnings as we work. This is also intended to be a project 'home page' where members can access important and up-to-date project information that exists somewhere else.



## Project Description

The Head Start program promotes school readiness for children under 5 years old from low-income families. HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF)’s Office of Head Start (OHS) oversees grant funding to local agencies providing Head Start services. OHS’s federal oversight responsibilities require significant grants management and a robust system of Training and Technical Assistance (T/TA), designed to strengthen grantee performance in accordance with federal standards so every enrolled child is prepared for success in school. However, T/TA data collection is fragmented, and data are housed in 27 disconnected platforms, including a limited and unscalable legacy system.

OHS is engaging 18F to help OHS procure a centralized system for relevant T/TA data, to track and analyze their work through a combined Path Analysis and Experimentation and Iteration (E&I) approach, with the potential to also execute an assisted acquisition. OHS lacks the in-house technical expertise to assess and implement an agile and human-centered solution, and is eager to develop their internal capacity to ensure the long-term success of this effort.

OHS is engaging 18F to help them identify and define the scope of the procurement for a new, modular T/TA platform. The engagement is set up to allow for the smooth transition from a Path Analysis to an Experiment & Iterate phase to an Assisted Acquisition if progressing to each successive phase is deemed appropriate by both parties, but we've set expectations with the partner that the end of each phase will represent a decision point about whether to move forward.

This project falls into 18F’s Human Services Portfolio, so in addition to providing immediate benefits to OHS staff and local Head Start grantees, we expect the outcomes and lessons-learned from this project to help inform our work with other federally-funded, locally-administered human services programs like Medicaid, SNAP and TANF as well. The 18F team who takes on this project can also benefit from support from the portfolio director and a network of other 18F staff who've worked in this space to share connections and lessons-learned to give them a leg up in their work.
